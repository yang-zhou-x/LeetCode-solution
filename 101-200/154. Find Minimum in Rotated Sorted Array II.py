'''
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
(i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).
Find the minimum element.
The array may contain duplicates.

Example 1:
Input: [1,3,5]
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: [2,2,2,0,1]
Output: 0

Note:
This is a follow up problem to Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array.
Would allow duplicates affect the run-time complexity? How and why?

class Solution:
    def findMin(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums) == 1 or nums[0] < nums[-1]:
            return nums[0]
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) >> 1
            if nums[mid] > nums[right]:
                left = mid + 1
            elif nums[mid] < nums[left]:
                right = mid
            else:
                right -= 1
        return nums[left]
